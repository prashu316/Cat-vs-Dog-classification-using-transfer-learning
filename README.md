# Cat-vs-Dog-classification-using-transfer-learning

## Aim
To create a neural network to classify images as cats or dogs using transfer learning

*What is transfer learning?*
Transfer learning is the method of using a pretrained network for other tasks either by retraining its layers or augmenting new trainable layers to the pretrained network

## Dataset Details
The dataset used consists of images of cats and dogs labelled appropriately and is available on the library, "Tensorflow Datasets"

## Sample outputs
Since the entire code was run locally and not on a notebook, i'll be posting images of the final model predictions along with the images:
